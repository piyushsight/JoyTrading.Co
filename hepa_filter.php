					HEPA filters are installed in many environments and process applications, but the method for testing them is well recognised and followed across the world.
					<br /><br />
					An aerosol generator is used to produce an oil aerosol that is introduced into the airstream that is going to pass through the HEPA filter to be tested, and an aerosol photometer is used to measure the amount of aerosol upstream and downstream of the filter. The result gives the performance of the HEPA filter reported and identifies if any leaks are present in the frame, seals or media. Ancillary equipment is required to inject, mix and sample the aerosol such as positive injection pumps, injection ports, sparge pipes, sample ports and scanning probes.
					<br /><br />
					With over 20 years of experience we have the most developed, robust and extensive range of equipment to meet your testing needs today and will continue to innovate to improve testing confidence and compliance.
